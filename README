This is a basic structure for me to start from as I explore:

Node.js
Express.js
CoffeeScript
Jade
Compass/Sass/Blueprint

The watch command that I'm currently using to keep everything reloading correctly is:

function nodewatch() {
  find . | grep coffee$ | xargs coffee -cwl & 
  
  if [ $1 ]
  then
    nodemon $1.js &
  else
    nodemon app.js &
  fi
  
  compass watch public/ &
}
